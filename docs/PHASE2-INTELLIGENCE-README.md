## üéØ Multi-Model Support

### Intelligent Model Selection

The system now supports multiple AI models, with **Gemma3n** as the primary model:

- **gemma3n:e4b** (Primary) - Advanced reasoning, thesis analysis, and scholarly research
- **gemma3n:e2b** (Secondary) - Fast reasoning, text analysis, and theological reasoning
- **nomic-embed-text:v1.5** - Semantic embeddings and vector search
- **qwen2.5vl:7b** - Vision analysis for document layout and scanned text
- **phi3.5:3.8b-mini-instruct-q8_0** - Fast reasoning and structured analysis

### Automatic Task Routing

```typescript
// The system automatically selects the optimal model
const result = await multiModelService.executeTask('theological-reasoning', query, {
  requirements: { reasoning: 9, accuracy: 8, creativity: 7 }
});
```

### Performance Optimization

- **Real-time Performance Tracking** - Monitors model speed, accuracy, and success rates
- **Adaptive Load Balancing** - Routes tasks based on current model performance
- **Intelligent Fallbacks** - Seamlessly switches models if one becomes unavailable

## üéì Adaptive Learning

### Personalized Learning Paths

The system creates unique learning journeys for each user:

```typescript
// Start a personalized learning session
const sessionId = await adaptiveLearning.startLearningSession(userId, documentId);

// System automatically adapts content to user's level and preferences
const personalizedContent = await adaptiveLearning.generatePersonalizedContent(
  userId, documentId, sessionId
);
```

### Dynamic Expertise Calculation

- **Multi-Factor Assessment** - Considers content complexity, user engagement, and comprehension
- **Continuous Adaptation** - Adjusts difficulty and content style based on performance
- **Learning Velocity Tracking** - Monitors and optimizes individual learning speed

### Personalized Features

- **Adaptive Prompts** - Questions and content tailored to user's expertise level
- **Learning Style Recognition** - Identifies visual, analytical, practical, or theoretical preferences
- **Progress Reinforcement** - Celebrates achievements and provides encouraging feedback

## üîç Semantic Search

### Intelligent Knowledge Retrieval

Beyond keyword matching, the system understands meaning and context:

```typescript
// Semantic search with context awareness
const results = await semanticSearch.search(query, {
  userId,
  currentDocument,
  currentChapter,
  userExpertiseLevel: 7,
  preferredTopics: ['theology', 'history']
});
```

### Advanced Search Features

#### Contextual Search
Search within the current reading context with intelligent radius:

```typescript
// Search around current chapter with configurable radius
const contextualResults = await semanticSearch.contextualSearch(
  query, context, radius: 3
);
```

#### Concept Exploration
Deep dive into biblical and theological concepts:

```typescript
// Explore concepts with varying depth levels
const exploration = await semanticSearch.exploreConcept(
  'redemption', context, depth: 'deep'
);
```

### Enhanced Result Quality

- **Relevance Scoring** - Multi-factor relevance calculation
- **Semantic Similarity** - Understanding of related concepts and themes
- **Cross-References** - Intelligent linking between related passages
- **Concept Indexing** - Fast retrieval based on concepts

## üöÄ Enhanced Agent Coordinator

### Hybrid Intelligence Approach

The Enhanced Agent Coordinator combines all Phase 2 capabilities:

```typescript
// Single endpoint that intelligently routes through all systems
const response = await enhancedCoordinator.handleUserInteraction(
  "What does Paul teach about grace?",
  'question',
  {
    userId,
    userExpertiseLevel: 6,
    preferredTopics: ['pauline-theology', 'soteriology'],
    currentDocument: 5,
    currentChapter: 3
  }
);
```

### Intelligent Query Analysis

1. **Intent Recognition** - Determines whether query is search, question, exploration, or comparison
2. **Complexity Assessment** - Evaluates query difficulty and required reasoning depth
3. **Optimal Routing** - Selects best approach: semantic search, adaptive learning, multi-model, or hybrid
4. **Response Enhancement** - Adds related concepts, suggested questions, and personalized insights
